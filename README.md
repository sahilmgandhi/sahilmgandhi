### Hello there 👋

I'm Sahil Gandhi, and am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer II @confluentinc. These days, I work on various backend services on ConfluentCloud's control plane and compute platform.


I hold degrees from UCLA with a BS in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (summa cum laude) and an MS in Distributed and Big Data Systems, have published some papers in the database world (and several white papers in other fields), and also several patents in the systems space.
