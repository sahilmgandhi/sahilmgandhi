### Hello there 👋

I'm Sahil Gandhi, and am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer II @confluentinc. These days, I work on various backend services on ConfluentCloud's control plane and compute platform.


I graduated from UCLA in 2020 with a Masters in Computer Science, focusing on Distributed Systems, and prior to that got my Bachelors from UCLA in 2019 in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (Summa cum laude).
