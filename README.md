### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Sahil Gandhi, and am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer II @confluentinc. These days, I work on various backend services on ConfluentCloud's control plane and compute platform.


I graduated from UCLA in 2020 with a Masters in Computer Science (focusing on Distributed Systems), and prior to that got my Bachelors from UCLA in 2019 in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.
